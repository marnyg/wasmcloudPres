## 1. Technology Maturity

- **WebAssembly Ecosystem**:
    - WebAssembly, while promising, is still evolving, especially for server-side use cases.
    - Language support and tooling for WebAssembly are improving but not as mature as traditional environments.
- **WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types) Specification**:
    - The WIT spec, crucial for wasmCloud's interface model, is relatively new and subject to changes.
    - Tool support for WIT is limited compared to established IDL systems.
- **wasmCloud itself**:
    - As a newer platform, wasmCloud may undergo significant changes as it matures.
    - Long-term stability and backward compatibility are yet to be proven at scale.

## 2. Ecosystem Limitations

- **Limited Provider Availability**:
    - The number of pre-built capability providers is currently limited compared to ecosystems like Docker or Java.
    - Custom provider development may be necessary, requiring additional resources.
- **Sparse Tooling Ecosystem**:
    - Lack of mature CI/CD pipelines specifically tailored for wasmCloud deployments.
    - Absence of equivalent tools like Argo CD, Helm, or Cert-Manager in the wasmCloud ecosystem.
    - Limited observability and monitoring tools specifically designed for wasmCloud environments.

## 3. Performance Considerations

- **Single-Threaded Nature**:
    - wasmCloud components are single-threaded, which may not be optimal for all workloads.
    - Scaling is achieved through multiple instances, which can increase communication overhead.
- **Inter-Process Communication Bottlenecks**:
    - Highly parallel workloads with intensive inter-process communication might face performance issues.
    - Examples include complex scientific simulations or large-scale data processing pipelines requiring frequent synchronization.
## 4. Learning Curve and Skills

- **New Programming Model**: Developers need to learn the actor model and capability-based security, which differs from traditional development approaches.
- **WebAssembly Knowledge**: Requires understanding of WebAssembly concepts and limitations.
- **Limited Pool of Experienced Developers**: As a newer technology, finding developers with wasmCloud experience may be challenging.
