### Similarities:

- Both provide persistence for application data
- Both support various data models (key-value, document, relational)

### Differences:

- Traditional: Often requires direct database connections, connection string management
- wasmCloud: State accessed through capability providers, abstracting connection details
- wasmCloud makes it easier to switch between different state backends
- wasmCloud's approach reduces the attack surface by limiting direct database access
