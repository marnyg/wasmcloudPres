### Similarities:
- All provide execution environments for code
- Aim for portability across different platforms

### Differences:
- Docker: Full OS-level virtualization, includes entire filesystem
- wasmtime: Lightweight WebAssembly runtime, language-agnostic
- Traditional Runtimes: Language-specific, include features like garbage collection
- Security: wasmtime has a smaller attack surface compared to Docker
- Startup Time: wasmtime typically faster than Docker, comparable to optimized traditional runtimes
- Memory Usage: wasmtime generally more efficient than Docker, can be more efficient than traditional runtimes depending on the application
