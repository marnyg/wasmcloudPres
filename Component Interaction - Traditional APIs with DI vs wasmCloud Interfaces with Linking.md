## Communication Mechanism

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Direct function calls within the same memory space
    - Fastest performance, lowest latency
- **Network APIs**:
    - HTTP/RPC calls over the network
    - Language-agnostic, but requires serialization/deserialization
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Typically use network APIs between containers
    - Can use more efficient IPC mechanisms when on the same host
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Uses message passing, abstracting whether components are local or distributed
    - Uniform interface for both local and remote interactions

## 2. Dependency Management

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Managed by language-specific package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
    - Tightly coupled, requires recompilation for updates
- **Network APIs**:
    - Looser coupling, dependencies managed through API versioning
    - Can update services independently as long as API contract is maintained
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Dependencies encapsulated within each container
    - Managed through container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Dependencies declared through capability contracts
    - Linking managed by the wasmCloud runtime, supporting dynamic updates

## 3. Deployment and Scaling

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Deployed as part of the main application
    - Scaled by scaling the entire application
- **Network APIs**:
    - Deployed as separate services
    - Can be scaled independently, but requires load balancing
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Each component deployed as a separate container
    - Fine-grained scaling of individual containers
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Components deployed as WebAssembly modules
    - Seamless scaling from edge to cloud, managed by the wasmCloud runtime

## 4. Language/Platform Dependencies

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Typically language-specific
    - Tied to the host application's runtime
- **Network APIs**:
    - Language-agnostic, but may have language-specific client libraries
    - Dependent on network protocol (HTTP, gRPC, etc.)
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Can contain any language/runtime, but tied to Linux containers
    - Requires Docker runtime
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Language-agnostic (any language that compiles to WebAssembly)
    - Requires wasmCloud runtime, but components are highly portable

## 5. Security Model

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Shares the security context of the host application
    - Vulnerable to supply chain attacks
- **Network APIs**:
    - Security managed through network-level controls (firewalls, API gateways)
    - Requires careful handling of authentication and authorization
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Isolation provided by container runtime
    - Security managed through container policies and network controls
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Built-in capability-based security model
    - Fine-grained control over what each component can access

## 6. State Management

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Can directly share state within the application
    - Potential for tight coupling and global state issues
- **Network APIs**:
    - Each service manages its own state
    - Requires careful handling of distributed state and consistency
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Each container can manage state independently
    - Often use external state stores for persistence and sharing
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Component model encourages stateless design
    - State managed through capability providers, abstracting storage details

## 7. Development and Testing

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Easy to develop and unit test
    - Integration testing can be complex for large applications
- **Network APIs**:
    - Can develop and test services independently
    - Requires managing multiple services for full integration testing
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Consistent development and testing environments
    - Can be complex to set up for local development
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Encourages modular development with clear interfaces
    - Can test Components in isolation or with mock capability providers

## 8. Versioning and Updates

- **In-Process Libraries**:
    - Versioning managed by package manager
    - Updates require recompilation and redeployment of the entire application
- **Network APIs**:
    - Versioning managed through API versions
    - Can deploy updates independently, but may need to maintain multiple versions
- **Docker Containers**:
    - Versioning of entire containers
    - Can update containers independently, orchestration manages transitions
- **wasmCloud**:
    - Versioning of individual Components and capability providers
    - Supports live updates without downtime
