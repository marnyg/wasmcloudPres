### How it works conceptually
[[From infra or devops perspective]]
[[From developer perspective]]
### Example Project structure
[[Example Project]]
### Why care
[[Separation of business logic from runtime logic]]
[[Better networking]]
[[Easier scaling]]
[[Modern features by default]]
[[Better local dev (maybe)]]
### How it Relates to things you already know
[[Runtime Environments - Docker vs wasmtime vs Traditional Runtimes (C-Sharp or Java)]]
[[Orchestration - Kubernetes vs wasmCloud]]
[[System Architecture - Microservices vs wasmCloud Component]]
[[Component Interaction - Traditional APIs with DI vs wasmCloud Interfaces with Linking]]
[[Scalability Model - Kubernetes Scaling vs wasmCloud Scaling]]
[[State Management - Traditional Databases vs wasmCloud State Providers]]
[[Security Model - Kubernetes vs wasmCloud]]
