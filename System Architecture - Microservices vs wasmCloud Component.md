### Similarities:
- Both promote modular, distributed application design
- Manage communication between workloads
- Provide scalability and fault tolerance

### Differences:
- Microservices: Often language-specific, heavier weight, more independent
- WasmCloud Component: have a more uniform approach to state management and capability access
- Security: wasmCloud lattices have built-in security and capability management
- Network Configuration: Kubernetes and traditional systems require more network setup, wasmCloud abstracts this away. 
- WasmCloud Component: Language-agnostic, lightweight, more standardized communication
	- F.ex: no load balancing between instances
- Heterogeneity: wasmCloud lattices can more easily span from edge to cloud
